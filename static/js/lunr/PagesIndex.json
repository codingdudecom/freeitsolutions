protections and consequences for internet service providers ISPs users and copyright owners in the digital landscape In this article I will show you a few simple but effective methods to deal with copyright infringement Lets get started 1 Copyright Infringement How To Spot It How To Find Who Stole Your Content First you will have to find out if your content has been stolen How do you do that Finding Text Content Copyright Infringements Just use Google Here are just a few Google queries that you can use to detect copyright infringement for text content 1 intitletitle of your content to search for pages that have your contents title in the page title 2 inurlkeyword to search for webpages that have a certain keyword in the url 3 siteyoursitecom to exclude your website from the search results Otherwise your site will show up when you search for your content 4 OR you can use this operator to combine multiple queries So the query will find results matching either one or another condition Example Lets say you are a photographer and you wrote a piece about A Photographers Journey From Beginner To Pro examplecomphotographerjourneybeginnerpro To find if your content has been

of me without my permission No Can someone use an image created by me without my permission No To find if your images have been stolen or are distributed without permission you can also use Google Google has had for quite some time the ability to search similar images Google Search By Imageimgcopyrightinfringementgooglesearchbyimagejpg Simply go to Google switch to image search Either drag and drop your original image onto the search bar or click the Search By Image icon and input the URL of the image or upload the image you want to search Google will try and find identical or similar images to yours You will have to spot which images are copyright infringements Watermark Your Photos If dont want or dont know how to deal with copyright infringements for photos and images the best

which is a free service from Google in which you can enter queries like the one above and the service will notify you via email when a match has been found New Google Alerts 2019imgcopyrightinfringementnewgooglealertsjpg 2 How To Report To Google A Website For Stealing Content DMCA Google Notice Once you identified the stolen content and the website that is posting it without permission you can file a DMCA notice to Google There is a DMCA Google service but its not too friendly imho Anyway this is the most effective way to stop the copyright infringing material to spread through Google Depending on the type of copyright infringement Google has multiple forms that you can use to submit your DMCA claim DMCA Google Notice For Web Results If you want to file a DMCA report for Google web results go to DMCA Google Notice For Web Resultshttpswwwgooglecomwebmasterstoolslegalremovalrequesthlenpid0complainttype1 These reports act like legal DMCA takedown notices so Google is forced by law to take action You will have to fill in your name and state that you are the copyright holder or legal representative for the copyright holder Describe what the copyright infringement is and then very important 1 place one or more links to your original content 2 place one or more link to the infringing page The good news is that most of these DMCA takedown notices are handled swiftly by Google and it takes about 24 hours for them to remove the infringing result from their search results DMCA Google Notice For Images If you want to file a DMCA report for Google Image search results go to DMCA Google Notice For Web Resultshttpswwwgooglecomwebmasterstoolslegalremovalrequesthlenpid3complainttype1 The data you need to put in is similar to the DMCA Google report for web search results The only difference is that instead of the link to the infringing image you will have to copypaste the image search result link Simply right click on the infringing image search result and copy the link Google Image Search Link For DMCA Reportimgcopyrightinfringementgoogleimagesearchlinkjpg YouTube Copyright Infringement Complaints And Other Google DMCA Takedown Reports

5 Report alleged copyright infringement Googlehttpswwwgooglecomwebmasterstoolslegalremovalrequesthlenpid5complainttype1 effectively April 2019 Google has been closed down so this tool will also probably be removed 3 How To Deal With Content Copyright Infringement Outside Google Reporting copyright infringement to Google will probably get resolved by Google removing the pages with the stolen content from the search results But the content will still be out there What else can I do to remove stolen content from a website Besides hiring a lawyer and suing the site here are a few other things that anybody can do Contact The Hosting Provider Of The Website With The Stolen Content Learn this term well DMCA Takedown Notice Im not a lawyer and in some cases hiring one could be the only way to resolve a copyright infringement case But any person can request to have their copyrighted content taken off a website if it constitutes copyright infringement Assuming that contacting the website owner and asking him to take down the infringing content has failed heres what you can do Use a tool for IP whois lookuphttpswwwultratoolscomtoolsipWhoisLookup and input the domain of the infringing website This will give you info about the hosting provider that hosts the infringing website Usually this contains a contact email address Look for something like abusehostingprovidercom and send them an email explaining the situation There are some requirements for the DMCA notice 1 Make it in writing this includes both hardcopy or digital 2 Sign it whether in writing of via electronic signature just put your name by the copyright owner or agent 3 Identify the original copyrighted work or works you claim has been infringed 4 Identify the material that is infringing your copyrighted work 5 Include contact information so the designated agent can reach you if necessary 6 Include a statement your complaint is in good faith 7 Include a statement the information in the notification is accurate and 8 Include a statement that under penalty of perjury you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed Hosting Provider ISP

hosting provider ISP will probably respond to your complaint in a couple of days and hopefully will take action If they dont then you have to contact a lawyer and see what else you can do about them Fortunately there are also other steps you can take to remove copyrighted content from the web File DMCA Complaints To Free File Upload And Sharing Services Very often websites that steal content especially software content ebooks etc post it on free file upload and sharing services There are a lot of these services Usually the copyright infringing website will place the files on multiple such services Can I do anything about that Yes you can All these file sharing services are obligated by law to list on their websites a link to instructions on how to file a DMCA complaint for copyright infringement File Sharing DMCA Abuse Email Addresses Most of the times they will list an email looking like abusefilesharingservicecom or dmcafilesharingservicecom I dont particullary like these sites you might imagine why so I will not list their links Heres a list of file sharing sites and the email addresses where they receive DMCA notices 1 RapidGator abuserapidgatornet 2 LittleByte

accurate and under penalty of perjury I am the owner of an exclusive right that is believed infringed full name date How Can Copyright Infringement Affect Your SEO Copyright Infringement Will Reduce Your Income If you are monetizing your content then for sure copyright infringement will be a huge problem Obviously if there are a lot of websites stealing your content and offering it for free you will get less visitors to your website One big SEO signal that Google uses is search result CTR So the more clicks you get on a search result the higher the ranking for that page will be Now consider this Which search result will get more clicks One that offers stuff for free or one that doesnt This is why its important at least to be aware of the fact that people are not always nice There are a lot of websites that make money by stealing other peoples work As unfair as it might sound those sites are more popular than yours just because they are offering commercial stuff for free You will never be able to cut your loses down to 0 but if you keep an eye on things then you will be able to limit them Copyright Infringement Will Reduce Your Traffic Even if your content is not commercial so you are also offering it for free still copyright infringement will potentially affect your Google ranking First because Google seems to favor sites with more content Because the infringing website is probably stealing content from others too it will for sure have more content than you and publish more frequently This means that they will rank higher than you By filing DMCA notices for those sites you can instantly boost your rankings I know this from experience After finding not one but 4 sites that copied content from my website all ranking above me I filed a Google DMCA report In 24 hours the pages were removed from Google search results and I jumped 4 positions up Please note that search results on page 1 get 90 of the traffic for a certain keyword From that aprox 60 go to the positions 1 to 3 So a bost of 4 places up only for one keyword can mean double traffic or even more for that keyword And that is only for one keyword and you can imagine that the infringing pages take traffic for more than one keyword Conclusions Copyright Infringement And SEO Fighting against copyright infringement is not easy it requires work but you can do it I hope you find the information in
