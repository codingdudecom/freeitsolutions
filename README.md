## About this project

This is a Hugo project which originally started as a test of this technology for creating websites that can be stored on the GitHub infrastructure.

The freeitsolutions.com website is built around the idea that there is a free solution for almost any IT problem. The challenge is however to find that solution.

On this website I have gathered the very best free resources for:
- Photoshop
- SEO
- Web Design

I'm still adding to the list, so stay tuned.
