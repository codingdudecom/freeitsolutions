[Ubbersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/) is an amazing online keyword tool. 

Neil Patel (one of my favorite SEO gurus) has purchased this tool a while back and placed it on his site.
You can use the tool for free.

What can I say, it's simply the best.

### How does Ubersuggest work? ###

You key in a keyword or phrase that you want to use, and the tool will suggest (or ubersuggest) alternative keyword ideas.

Not only that, but it will also give you some info regarding:

Apparently, the results are compiled combination Google Keyword Planner and Google suggested keywords.

[LSI Graph](https://lsigraph.com/analysis/) is a LSI keyword tool. 

### What Does LSI Keywords Mean?###

Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a system search engines use to analyze the other words people use surrounding a given topic. LSI keywords are words and phrases with a high degree of correlation to your target topic.

In short, if you look at the end of Google search results page *"Searches related to"* that's what LSI is. LSI keywords are keywords in the same family as the the topic of the keyword you input. That is determined by what other people search for in relation to their initial search.

LSI Graph takes in a keyword and provides a list of related keywords.

Here's how the results look like

[Google AdWords > Keyword Planner Tool](https://adwords.google.com) is probably one of the best known tool for keyword research. I left it at the end especially because it's so well known.

Google AdWords is mainly for creating Google ads, not doing SEO or keyword research. That said, there is a strong overlap between keywords advertisers are focusing and what people are searching.

Because of that, this is considered *the main Google keyword volume checker*.

The way to use it has changed several times during the last 10 years. I'm describing how Google AdWords Keyword Planner Tool looks like in 2018 and how to use it.

To open Google AdWords Keyword Planner simply go to the **Keyword Planner** in the **Tools** menu:
