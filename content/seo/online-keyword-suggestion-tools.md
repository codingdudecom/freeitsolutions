Here's the truth:

> Doing keyword research for search engine optimization is crucial for getting a your website to rank higher.
But **what does keyword research** actually mean?

> Basically, it means trying to guess which keywords and combination of keywords will attract the most traffic.
Since guessing is not a science and SEO is, let's take a look at how to do keyword research like a PRO for free.

In this list, I've gathered the best online keyword suggestion tools that you can use for free.

1. [Ubbersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)
2. [Google Correlate](https://www.google.com/trends/correlate/)
3. [KWFinder](https://kwfinder.com)

## 1. Ubbersuggest (Neil Patel) ##

[Ubbersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/) is an amazing online keyword tool. 

Neil Patel (one of my favorite SEO gurus) has purchased this tool a while back and placed it on his site.
You can use the tool for free.

What can I say, it's simply the best.

### How does Ubersuggest work? ###

You key in a keyword or phrase that you want to use, and the tool will suggest (or ubersuggest) alternative keyword ideas.

Not only that, but it will also give you some info regarding:

- Estimated Search Volume
- CPC (Cost Per Click in Google AdWords)
- Competitive Level

Apparently, the results are compiled combination Google Keyword Planner and Google suggested keywords.

You can export the results in CSV and start choosing your focus keywords that will work best for you.
