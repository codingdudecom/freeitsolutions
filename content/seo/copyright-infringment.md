Good news is that there are measures you can take against this kind of situations. Distributing copyrighted content without the author's permission constitutes **copyright infringment** and it's illegal. 

In this article I will show you a few simple but **effective methods to deal with copyright infringment**.

Let's get started.

## Copyright Infringment - How To Spot It ##

### How To Find Who Stole Your Content ###

First, you will have to find out if your content has been stolen.

How do you do that?


#### Finding Text Content Copyright Infringments ####

Just use Google. Here are just a few Google queries that you can use to detect copyright infringment for text content.

1. **intitle:"title of your content"** to search for pages that have your content's title in the page title
2. **inurl:keyword** to search for webpages that have a certain keyword in the url
3. **-site:yoursite.com** to exclude your website from the search results. Otherwise your site will show up when you search for your content.
4. **OR** you can use this operator to combine multiple queries. So the query will find results matching either one or another condition

Example:
Let's say you are a photographer and you wrote a piece about "A Photographer's Journey From Beginner To Pro" example<span>.</span>com/photographer-journey-beginner-pro

To find if your content has been stolen you would do a Google search like this:

`intitle:"A Photographer's Journey From Beginner To Pro" OR "A Photographer's Journey From Beginner To Pro" OR inurl:"photographer-journey" -site:example.com`

Alternatively, you can use [Copyscape](https://www.copyscape.com/) which is servivce where you can input your URL and it will search for pages that that copied your content.

#### Finding Image Copyright Infringments ####

Can someone use a picture of me without my permission?

No.

Can someone use an image created by me without my permission?

No.

To find if your images have been stolen or are distributed without permission you can also use Google. Google has had for quite some time the ability to search similar images.

Simply go to Google, switch to image search and drag and drop your original image onto the search bar. Google will try and find identical or similar images to yours. You will have to spot which images are copyright infringments.

### How To Get Notified When Somebody Steals Your Content ###


I use [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) which is a free service from Google in which you can enter queries like the one above and the service will notify you via email when a match has been found.

## How To Report A Website For Stealing Content - DMCA Google Notice ##

Once you identified the stolen content and the website that is posting it without permission you can file a DMCA notice to Google.

There is a DMCA Google service, but it's not too friendly imho. Anyway, this is the most effective way to stop the copyright infringing material to spread through Google.

Depending on the type of copyright infringment, Google has multiple forms that you can use to submit your DMCA claim.

### DMCA Google Notice For Web Results ###

If you want to file a DMCA report for Google web results go to: [DMCA Google Notice For Web Results](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/legal-removal-request?hl=en&pid=0&complaint_type=1)

These reports act like legal DMCA takedown notices, so Google is forced by law to take action.

You will have to fill in your name and state that you are the copyright holder or legal representative for the copyright holder. Describe what the copyright infringment is and then very important:

1. place one or more links to your original content
2. place one or more link to the infringing page

The good news is that most of these DMCA takedown notices are handled swiftly by Google and it takes about 24 hours for them to remove the infringing result from their search results.

### DMCA Google Notice For Images ###

If you want to file a DMCA report for Google Image search results go to: [DMCA Google Notice For Web Results](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/legal-removal-request?hl=en&pid=3&complaint_type=1)

The data you need to put in is similar to the DMCA Google report for web search results. The only difference is that, instead of the link to the infringing image, you will have to copy/paste the image search result link. Simply right click on the infringing image search result and copy the link.
