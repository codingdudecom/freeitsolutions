## Free Photoshop Tutorials for Beginners & Advanced ##
<br/>

>If you are a Photoshop beginner and you want to learn Photoshop (for free or not) it's very important to choose a good teacher.

Here's my list of websites from where to learn Photoshop for free if you are a beginner.

These are all sites tried and tested by me. 

They have high quality content that is perfect for Photoshop projects being photo editing, photo manipulations, drawings, product design, etc.

Please note that most of these websites have a category called **Basics** and that's where you should start if you are a beginner.


### 1. [PSD Dude - Photoshop Tutorials &amp; Resources](http://www.psd-dude.com) ###

Also the free Photoshop actions that you can download are a must, PSDDude Photoshop actions are really high quality.

I should also mention the [PSDDude YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/PSDDude?sub_confirmation=1) which has some wonderful tutorials for beginners.

## BONUS: Free Photoshop Resources ##
<br/>

> Practice these Photoshop tutorials and you will learn Photoshop for free. How about some graphic assets to use in your designs?

As a bonus for this list I though I'd share a few great sources for free Photoshop resources like:

- Free Photoshop Brushes
- Free Photoshop Actions
- Free Photoshop Layer Styles
- Free Photoshop Textures
- Free PSD Mockups

### 1. [Photoshop Supply - Free Photoshop Resources For Graphic Designers](https://www.photoshopsupply.com) ###

[![Photoshop Supply - Free Photoshop Resources For Graphic Designers](/img/photoshop/pssupply.png)](https://www.photoshopsupply.com)

The *PhotoshopSupply.com* website is relatively new, but it should get your attention really fast. They have a crisp and fresh feel, and they give **all their Photoshop resources for free**.

This site provides top quality free Photoshop resources for graphic designers. I would pay special attention to their free [**Photoshop mockups section**](https://www.photoshopsupply.com/category/mockups), but also the free Photoshop brushes, free Photoshop actions, free PSD patterns and templates, free vector shapes and free brushes.

### 2. [Textures4Photoshop - High Quality Textures for Free](http://www.textures4photoshop.com) ###

[![Textures4Photoshop - High Quality Textures for Free](/img/photoshop/textures4photoshop.png)](http://www.textures4photoshop.com)

Trust me:

As a graphics designer you will never have too many textures, images and backgrounds.

When creating Photoshop effects it's always useful to combine various textures or images to get the effect you want. But, it's not always easy to find the textures you need.

Check out the Textures4Photoshop database of **high quality textures &amp; images that you can download for free**.

I simply love this website, it has tons of free and awesome textures that you will not find anywhere else.

All textures are unique and very well crafted. The site contains not only free Photoshop textures, but also patterns (seamless and non-seamless).

Another thing is the amazing tool called [Textturizer](http://www.textures4photoshop.com/textturizer/), which is an **online text effect generator** that is pretty unique. It has lots of text effect presets, but you can also customize it and use in combination the free Photoshop textures available on the website.

## Conclusion ##

You can learn Photoshop for free.

Keep this list close and visit the sites and you will get better with Photoshop.
