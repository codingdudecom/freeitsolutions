## Why Github Is The Best Free Website Hosting?

Why is Github is really the best free website hosting youâ€™ll ever get?

Here are just a few reasons:

1. Github has a really strong high-availability infrastructure which will guarantee 99.99% uptime. This rivals even paid hosting providers.
1. It uses an in-built CDN (content delivery network) which means all requests will be served extremely fast from geographical locations closest to the requestor
1. Provides HTTPS out-of-the-box
1. Automatic backup and version management. All changes to your website stored and backed up automatically (basic Github functionality; you can fork, branch, etc)
1. Up to 10GB of storage per repository
1. Ability to easily transfer your website to any hosting provider (most of them provide Github integrations for migrating)
